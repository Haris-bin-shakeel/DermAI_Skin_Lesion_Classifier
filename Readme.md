# DermAI ‚Äî Skin Lesion Classification Using CNNs

A deep learning project aimed at automated skin lesion classification using the **HAM10000** dataset. This project demonstrates the practical application of image classification techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), marking a key milestone in my machine learning journey, guided by the **Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng**.

## Project Overview

Early detection of skin cancer is critical. This project leverages deep learning to build a CNN-based classifier capable of distinguishing between common skin lesions using dermatoscopic images. While primarily educational, the project reflects **industry-standard best practices** in data handling, model development, and evaluation.
